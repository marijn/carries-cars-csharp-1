# Carries Cars Sandbox and Examples in Kotlin
A sandbox with examples of domain modelling approaches in Kotlin. The purpose of these examples is to inspire you with different styles, not to dictate how it is supposed to be done.

Having a simple playground allows us to remain focussed on the problem that we want to tackle: Learning to implement domain models in code.
